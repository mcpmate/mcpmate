## 🌐 About MCPMate  
MCPMate is a unified **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** management tool designed for teams and developers to streamline the connection, configuration, and control of multiple MCP servers and clients.  
It’s built to provide one configuration interface, handle complex routing, caching, and audit workflows — so you can focus on building intelligent applications and workflows instead of infrastructure.  [oai_citation:0‡MCPMate](https://mcpmate.io/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
